# ARN v9 — Adaptive Reasoning Network

Brain-inspired persistent memory for AI agents. Runs locally, costs $0/month, fits in under 50MB on a Raspberry Pi 5.

Hi, I'm Mohamed. I'm a student at Columbus State Community College studying IT, and I built this because I wanted my AI agents to actually remember things between sessions without paying for a cloud service. It started as a side project on my Pi 5 and turned into something I think is worth sharing.

If you're building agents with OpenClaw, LangChain, or any framework where you keep re-explaining context to your agent every session, this might help.

## What it does

Your agent stores facts, the system remembers them across sessions, and when the agent needs context it gets back the relevant stuff — not by keyword match but by meaning. Ask "what does the user like to code in?" after storing "Mohamed prefers Python" and you get the Python answer back, even though "like" and "code" don't appear in the stored fact.

Under the hood it's a combination of things from neuroscience and ML:

- **Episodic + semantic split** — like hippocampus vs neocortex. Recent stuff is stored as specific episodes, repeated patterns get consolidated into general knowledge
- **Sentence embeddings** — using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (22MB) by default, with optional upgrades to bge-base (440MB) if you want higher quality
- **Cortical column voting** — 8 domain-specialized columns (code, conversation, facts, errors, etc.) that each evaluate incoming info
- **Calibrated prediction error** — tracks what counts as "surprising" per domain using Welford's algorithm, so truly novel info gets prioritized
- **Consolidation** — periodically clusters similar episodes into semantic memories (like what happens during sleep)
- **Contradiction detection** — when new info conflicts with stored info, it flags the conflict and keeps both with timestamps
- **Explicit temporal tagging** — because embeddings alone can't tell "used to prefer X" from "currently prefers Y", you can tag episodes with `time_context='past'|'current'|'future'`

## What it passes

Full results from the adversarial stress test (`benchmarks/stress_test.py`):

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Cross-session persistence (4 restarts + noise) | ✅ 3/3 facts recalled |
| Distractor resistance (5 needles in 500 haystack) | ✅ 5/5 found |
| Contradiction handling (most-recent-wins) | ✅ latest version wins |
| Temporal reasoning (with tagging) | ✅ current > past |
| Hallucination refusal | ✅ 3/3 flagged low-confidence |
| Paraphrase robustness | ✅ 6/6 reworded queries hit |
| Scale (1K and 3K episodes) | ✅ 100% accuracy, ~170ms latency |

Plus 40/40 on the main test suite.

## Quick start

### Option A — One-line installer (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuuhe99-del/arn-v9/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuuhe99-del/arn-v9.git ~/arn_v9
bash ~/arn_v9/install.sh
```

The installer:
- checks Python 3.10+
- installs pip dependencies
- sets up shell aliases (`arn` and `arn-cli`)
- starts the daemon (eliminates ~10s cold-start, keeps model hot)
- installs the OpenClaw skill if OpenClaw is detected
- runs the test suite to verify everything works

**Options:**
```bash
bash install.sh --dir /custom/path      # install somewhere else
bash install.sh --no-daemon             # skip daemon setup
bash install.sh --no-openclaw         # skip OpenClaw skill
bash install.sh --skip-tests            # faster install, skip tests
```

### Option B — Manual install

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers numpy
git clone https://github.com/tuuhe99-del/arn-v9.git
cd arn-v9
python3 -m arn_v9.tests.check_env   # verify environment
python3 -m arn_v9.tests.test_all    # run tests
```

### Basic usage

```python
from arn_v9 import ARNv9

arn = ARNv9(data_dir="./my_agent_memory")

# Store facts
arn.perceive("User prefers Python for scripting", importance=0.8)
arn.perceive("Deployed on Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM", importance=0.7)

# Recall by meaning
results = arn.recall("what does the user code in?", top_k=3)
for r in results:
    print(f"[{r['score']:.2f}] {r['content']}")

arn.close()
```

### With the plugin API (temporal tagging + confidence tiers)

```python
from arn_v9.plugin import ARNPlugin

with ARNPlugin(agent_id="my_agent", data_root="./memory") as p:
    # Tag facts with when they're true
    p.store("User used to prefer Python",
            time_context='past', importance=0.6)
    p.store("User now exclusively uses Rust",
            time_context='current', importance=0.8)

    # Queries with temporal keywords get filtered automatically
    results = p.recall("what does the user currently prefer?")
    # Returns Rust as rank 0, not Python

    # Check if recall is confident
    for r in results:
        if r['confidence_tier'] == 'low':
            print("I don't know — not enough matching info")
```

### REST API

```bash
# Run the server
python3 -m uvicorn arn_v9.api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8742

# Or via Docker
docker build -t arn-v9 .
docker run -p 8742:8742 -v arn_data:/data arn-v9
```

Then:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8742/v1/memory/store \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "user1", "content": "User likes dark mode", "importance": 0.5}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8742/v1/memory/recall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "user1", "query": "UI preferences", "top_k": 3}'
```

### Model tiers

You can pick the embedding model based on your constraints:

| Tier | Model | Size | Speed | Quality |
|------|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `nano` (default) | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 22MB | ~30ms | Good |
| `small` | all-mpnet-base-v2 | 420MB | ~60ms | Better |
| `base` | bge-base-en-v1.5 | 440MB | ~80ms | Best retrieval |
| `base-e5` | e5-base-v2 | 440MB | ~80ms | Alt. retrieval |

```python
# Set via env
export ARN_EMBEDDING_TIER=base

# Or at init
arn = ARNv9(embedding_tier='base')
```

In my stress tests, nano and bge-base both scored 7/7. The bigger model didn't win on any scenario. I'd stick with nano unless you have a specific reason.

## OpenClaw integration

Drop `openclaw_skill/SKILL.md` into `~/.openclaw/skills/arn-memory/` and the skill is auto-discovered. Your agent gets store/recall/context commands that invoke `scripts/arn_cli.py` under the hood.

See `ARN_V9_OPENCLAW_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` in the repo root for the full setup.

## What I know is rough

I'm being upfront about this because I want people to build on it, not waste time on dead ends:

- **No inter-agent memory sharing** — each agent_id gets isolated storage. If you want two agents to share knowledge, you'd need to build a sync layer. I haven't.
- **Consolidation is synchronous** — it runs on the main thread. Fine for small workloads, but if you're processing hundreds of stores per second you'd want to move it to a background thread or queue.
- **Contradiction detection is a word-overlap heuristic** — real NLI (natural language inference) would be better but too heavy for Pi 5. If you're deploying on beefier hardware, swapping in an NLI model would probably improve this a lot.
- **Temporal reasoning needs the agent to tag episodes** — the system can't automatically figure out "this fact is now outdated" without explicit `time_context`. Auto-inferring this from content is an open problem.
- **No multi-modal support** — text only. Adding image/audio embeddings is doable but not started.
- **Embedding model picks aren't great for non-English** — the defaults are English-tuned. Multilingual support would need a different model like `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`.
- **Tests have `@requires_embeddings` skips** — if you run without sentence-transformers installed, 7 of 40 tests skip. That's correct behavior but means the CI matrix needs both modes.
- **I'm not a seasoned ML engineer** — I'm a student. Some of the scoring weights, similarity thresholds, and consolidation parameters are empirically tuned but probably not optimal. If you have a better intuition for these, PRs welcome.

## Things I think would be valuable next

If you're looking for somewhere to contribute:

1. **Mem0/Zep comparison benchmark** — I started one but ran out of runway. Running ARN head-to-head on their published benchmarks would make this more credible.
2. **Async consolidation** — move it off the main thread so high-throughput agents don't stall.
3. **Cross-agent shared semantic layer** — read-only "organizational knowledge" that multiple agents can draw on.
4. **Better contradiction detection** — even a small NLI model would help.
5. **Multilingual embeddings** — swapping the default model for a multilingual one.
6. **ONNX quantized version** — smaller and faster for edge deployment.
7. **LangChain/CrewAI adapters** — I built the OpenClaw one because that's what I use. Other frameworks need their own thin wrappers.

## Connecting ARN to Claude / OpenClaw

This is the part most people struggle with, so here's the exact steps:

### With OpenClaw

The installer handles this automatically if OpenClaw is already set up. It copies `SKILL.md` into your skills directory. Once installed:

1. The `arn-memory` skill loads automatically when your agent starts
2. Your agent can call `arn recall` / `arn store` from any session
3. The daemon keeps the embedding model hot — 0.5s recall instead of 10s

Manual install if the auto-detection missed it:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/arn-memory
cp ~/arn_v9/arn_v9/openclaw_skill/SKILL.md ~/.ocplatform/workspace/skills/arn-memory/
```

### With any Claude setup (Claude.ai, Claude Code, custom)

Paste this into your system prompt or `AGENTS.md`:

```
You have persistent memory via ARN v9.

To store a fact:
  python3 ~/arn_v9/arn_client.py store "<fact>" --importance 0.8

To recall by meaning:
  python3 ~/arn_v9/arn_client.py recall "<question>"

To get context for a topic:
  python3 ~/arn_v9/arn_client.py context "<topic>"

Store facts when the user shares preferences, makes decisions, or tells you something worth remembering.
Recall before answering anything where past context might matter.
```

### With LangChain

```python
from arn_v9 import ARNv9

arn = ARNv9(data_dir="~/.arn_data/default")

# In your tool definition:
def remember(fact: str):
    """Store something worth remembering about this user."""
    arn.perceive(fact, importance=0.7)

def recall(query: str) -> str:
    """Recall relevant context before answering."""
    hits = arn.recall(query, top_k=3)
    return "\n".join(h["content"] for h in hits)
```

### Troubleshooting

**"No module named arn_v9"** → run `pip install -e ~/arn_v9` again

**Recall takes 10+ seconds** → daemon isn't running. Start it:
```bash
python3 ~/arn_v9/arn_daemon.py start &
```

**Daemon ping fails** → embedding model is still loading (first run downloads ~22MB). Wait 30s and retry.

**Nothing being recalled** → check you stored something first: `arn stats` shows episode count

## About

My name is Mohamed Mohamed. I'm an IT student at Columbus State Community College (currently on academic probation, not gonna hide that). I built this on a Raspberry Pi 5 I recovered from a corrupted SD card, using OpenClaw as my agent framework.

If you want to reach out, open an issue or reach me through the contacts in my GitHub profile. I'm not claiming this is production-grade enterprise software — I'm a student who built something that works and passes real adversarial tests. If you find bugs or have ideas, please say so.

Thanks for looking at this.
